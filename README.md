Objektiv
========================================

Objektiv is a small utility for your Mac that allows you to quickly
switch your default browser. It's mainly designed to help webdevs who
need to run a lot of different browsers while testing.

We built Objektiv to scratch an itch we at [nth loop][] were facing, and
to also learn all about Mac App development. It was built over the
course of a few months, on-and-off whenever we had time. It's
ridiculously over-engineered for such a simple utility; here are some of
the features at a glance:

 - A status-bar icon to quickly toggle your default browser
 - An optional global hotkey that will trigger an overlay window
 - Alternate items (‚å•) in the status icon menu will let you blacklist
   browsers that are incorrectly detected.
 - And many other details!

Building & Running
----------------------------------------

Objektiv requires [CocoaPods][] in order to be built.

After cloning this repository, run:

    $ pod install

in order to grab dependencies. Also, make sure that you open
`Objektiv.xcworkspace`, not `Objektiv.xcodeproj`.
