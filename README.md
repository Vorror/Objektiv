browser-selector
========================================

browser-selector is a small utility for your Mac that allows you to
quickly switch your default browser. It's mainly designed to help
webdevs who need to run a lot of different browsers while testing.

Building & Running
----------------------------------------

browser-selector depends on ZeroKit, which is defined as a git
submodule. After cloning this repository, run:

    $ git submodule update --init

in order to grab it. Next, you can just open the main
`browser-selector.xcodeproj` in XCode,  and you're set.
